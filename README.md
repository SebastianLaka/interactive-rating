# interactive-rating
Hi 😃
It's my 5th projet at frontend mentor in this repo.
I spend much time by get solution in JS😆. but it learned me a lot about forEach how use it, 
still i think that i don't know everything about this method. 😁 
I'm beginer in this, it's something new for me. 👍 

Project is interactive so it mean that after click at button from 1 to 5 you can click submit button.
Then you will get card who inform you about choosen number.

It was written by mobile first method in CSS. In future my projects will be more advanced(I mean about write @media queries and CSS) 👍 
I start build projects with JS where can i get more functions in project. 🤟

If you can help me to write better and more clean code please write to me i'll read and make it in my next projects 😉.
